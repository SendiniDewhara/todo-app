# Client Project

This is a **To-Do List Application** built using **React** and **Material UI** with a focus on priority task management. It also uses **Vite** for fast development and includes **toast notifications** for better user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Front-End:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for dynamic rendering.
- **Material UI**: A component library for React that provides pre-styled components and icons.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool for modern web development, providing lightning-fast dev server and bundle optimization.
- **Framer Motion**: A library used for animations and transitions.
- **React Toastify**: A simple library for showing notifications in the form of toast messages.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary language for the front-end logic.

### Back-End:
- **Not Applicable**: This project is focused on the front-end only. If you're building a full-stack project, you can use **Node.js/Express** or **Django/Flask** for back-end services.

### Database:
- **Not Applicable**: The project does not require a database. For a full-stack project, you could use **MongoDB** or **MySQL** depending on the need.

### Deployment:
- **Vercel / Netlify / GitHub Pages** (for front-end only)

## Features

- **To-Do List Management**: Allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks.
- **Priority Level for Tasks**: Tasks are assigned a priority level (High, Medium, Low) and displayed accordingly.
  - **High Priority** tasks are shown with a **Red** badge.
  - **Medium Priority** tasks are shown with a **Yellow** badge.
  - **Low Priority** tasks are shown with a **Green** badge.
- **Task Filter**: Filter tasks by **All**, **Completed**, and **Not Completed**.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes and devices.
